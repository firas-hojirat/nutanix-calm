A tool for scanning Kubernetes cluster for risky permissions in Kubernetes's Role-based access control (RBAC) authorization model. The tool was published as part of the "Securing Kubernetes Clusters by Eliminating Risky Permissions" research https://www.cyberark.com/threat-research-blog/securing-kubernetes-clusters-by-eliminating-risky-permissions/.

KubiScan helps cluster administrators identify permissions that attackers could potentially exploit to compromise the clusters. This can be especially helpful on large environments where there are lots of permissions that can be challenging to track. KubiScan gathers information about risky roles\clusterroles, rolebindings\clusterrolebindings, users and pods, automating traditional manual processes and giving administrators the visibility they need to reduce risk.
